;;; Commentary:
;;
;;   This package makes HOME/END keys smartly cycle to the beginning/end
;;   of a line, the beginning/end of the window, the beginning/end of
;;   the buffer, and back to POINT. With a prefix argument, behaves as
;;   functions `beginning-of-buffer'/`end-of-buffer'.
;;
;;   A first keypress moves POINT to the beginning/end of a line, or if
;;   already there, to the beginning/end of the window, or if already
;;   there, to the beginning/end of the buffer. Subsequent keypresses
;;   cycle through those operations until returning POINT to its start
;;   position. Invoking a PREFIX ARGUMENT prior to the keypress moves
;;   POINT consistent with PREFIX ARG M-x beginning-of-buffer /
;;   end-of-buffer.
;;
;;   Usage example:
;;
;;     (global-set-key [home] 'home-end-home)
;;     (global-set-key [end]  'home-end-end)
;;
;;   Note that some devices may define the HOME and END keys
;;   differently. For example, we have seen the END key defined as
;;   'select'.

;;; History:
;;
;; This is a total re-write of an identically-named package that had been bundled
;; into debian's `emacs-goodies-el'. In 2018, that package was marked for
;; 'retirement' due to seeming "to need substantial maintainance and have no
;; upstream home"[1]. The original version had been Copyright 1996 Kai Grossjohann and
;; Toby Speight, and Copyright 2002-2011 Toby Speight, both under GPL3.

  "React uniquely to repeated presses of the `home' key.

A first key-press moves the point to the beginning of the current
line; a second key-press moves the point to the beginning of the
current visible window, and; a third key-press moves the point to
the beginning of the buffer.

Additionally, with numeric ARG, this command calls function
`beginning-of-buffer' to move the point to the (N*10)% position
of the buffer.

Finally, the original point is pushed onto the `mark ring', so
one can easily return there using <prefix> `set-mark' ( (\\[set-mark]).

Recommended usage is to bind this function to the `home' key by,
for instance, placing the following in the .emacs file:
  `(global-set-key [home] \'home-end-home)'"
  (interactive "P")
  (if arg
    (beginning-of-buffer arg)
