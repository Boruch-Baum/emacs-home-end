This package for emacs makes HOME/END keys smartly cycle to the
beginning/end of a line, the beginning/end of the window, the
beginning/end of the buffer, and back to POINT. With a prefix
argument, behaves as functions `beginning-of-buffer'/`end-of-buffer'.

A first keypress moves POINT to the beginning/end of a line, or if
already there, to the beginning/end of the window, or if already
there, to the beginning/end of the buffer. Subsequent keypresses
cycle through those operations until returning POINT to its start
position. Invoking a PREFIX ARGUMENT prior to the keypress moves
POINT consistent with PREFIX ARG M-x beginning-of-buffer /
end-of-buffer.

Note that this is a total re-write of an identically-named package
that had been bundled into debian's `emacs-goodies-el'. In 2018, that
package was marked for 'retirement' due to seeming "to need
substantial maintainance and have no upstream home"[1]. The original
version had been Copyright 1996 Kai Grossjohann and Toby Speight, and
Copyright 2002-2011 Toby Speight, both under GPL3.
